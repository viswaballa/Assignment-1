###### Recommendations
 
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
(This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would advise the company to expand on their crypto options. Overall, Robinhood is known for the 
stock trading - ranging to being able to do options as well but their crypto selection is very limited 
as we can see through the app itself. The reason I would focus on crypto expansion is because of how much 
it has grown across the globe the last few years with so much growth potential still ahead for the future. 
A lot of crypto is not traded on these investment apps itself leading to many investors going strictly to 
apps that only trade crypto. If they were to expand on this, then they would beat out a lot of their competetion 
as they would have expanded well into crypto and stocks. They would be comepteting well against crypto firms 
like coinbase, and bitmart, and other traditional investment platforms like fidelity. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This would benefit the company because of the crypto growth we are seeing across the globe today. 
More expansion of crypto would lead to more users for the app, which would boost their business and 
the sales they are doing. Additionally, this would make them a top tier competetior against anyone in the 
investment world against anyone in that business. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The main technology they would have to utilize would be blockchain techonology which facilitates the trading 
of crypto which is a decentralized exchange 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies are approriate for for the solution because crypto is a decentralized exchange 
and it needs to use blockchain technology in order to flow the trading of crypto. Blockchain technology 
is a shared decentralized ledger of transactions. This is important as investors are able to execute and 
confirm transactions without the need of a clearing authority.
